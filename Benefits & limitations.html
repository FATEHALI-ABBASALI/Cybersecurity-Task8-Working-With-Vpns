<p> <strong>Benefits</strong>: encrypts traffic on untrusted networks, hides public IP from sites/trackers, prevents simple network-level eavesdropping, allows secure access to geographically restricted content (subject to provider/policy). </p> <p> <strong>Limitations</strong>: does not guarantee complete anonymity (provider can see your traffic metadata), some free providers throttle speeds or limit servers, potential DNS/WebRTC leaks if misconfigured, jurisdiction of provider may affect privacy, performance penalty (latency, throughput). </p>
